A majority grow old with no pension due to unemployment, low incomes, and disability in their younger days. As they get older, children and relations may be in distant cities working and the elderly people live alone.</p>\n<p>They become poorer as they age just as the costs of medical care go sky-high and they lack insurance but have to face diabetes, heart conditions, arthritis, cognitive impairments, dementia and other ailments. Costs to travel to hospitals, get a diagnosis, receive treatment or undergo surgery are extremely high in Kenya, especially in Busia County, which has inadequately equipped health facilities. The nearest hospitals with better facilities are in either Eldoret, 100 miles away, or Kisumu 70 miles away. Most of the aged people cannot afford the costs of these facilities.</p>\n<p>Even if they made it to a private or government hospital, most elderly people have no health insurance or hold the government provided insurance that provides only basic outpatient cover and very limited payments for treatment, surgery and hospital stays. Some above 70 years of age receive a government cash transfer of Kshs 2,000 (US$ 15) per month that can barely purchase a few meals and is not enough to meet costs of medical care. For elders with disabilities, assistive devices such as hearing aids, eyeglasses, canes, walking frames and wheelchairs are unaffordable. They live in the dilemma of lacking independence due to disability but have nobody to assist them in their lonely lives. As a result, elders live lonely and sickly lives of pain with untreated ailments.</p>\n<p>We have already provided land for this elder care service with water supply, electricity, storage facilities and a building to administer the service located close to the Secondary School on the Nambale to Busibwabo Road.</p>\n<p>Funds raised from this campaign will be used to set up a service for elderly people in Nambale town in Busia County of Kenya, which will provide them with:</p>\n<p>(1) Regular medical diagnostic checks by local health staff and volunteer medics so they can be assisted with treatment or referral to hospitals for timely care.</p>\n<p>(2) Eye glasses, hearing aids, walking frames, wheelchairs and other disability assistive devices.</p>\n<p>(3) A communal facility with loving care and company to reduce loneliness and improve their psychological conditions.</p>\n<p>(4) A food bank to feed elderly people.</p>'),

The wooden benches outside often fill up quickly with villagers seeking treatment for their ailments. They come to me because they trust me, and because I am their only hope. Many can‚Äôt afford the expensive care in the town‚Äôs hospitals, and the nearest clinic is hours away.</p>\n<p>Every day, I do my best with the little I have‚Äîsome basic medicines, a stethoscope, and my training. Most of the time, I can manage the common cases‚Äîfevers, coughs, cuts, and wounds. But there are moments that shake me, moments that remind me how much more I need to truly serve my people.</p>\n<p>One such moment came when a farmer brought his elderly mother to my chamber. She had been complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath for days. As I examined her, it was clear that her condition was serious‚Äîlikely a heart problem. But I didn‚Äôt have the tools or the specialized knowledge to treat her properly. I gave her some medicine to ease the pain and urged them to go to the town hospital. Yet I knew, as I looked into the farmer‚Äôs worried eyes, that they couldn‚Äôt afford the journey or the expensive treatment that awaited them.</p>\n<p>This is the reality I face every day. Born and raised in this village, I know the struggles of these people firsthand. My family, too, once relied on the kindness of others for basic needs. I worked hard to become a general physician, studying diligently so that I could return and serve those who needed me most. But now, after years of running my chamber, I‚Äôve come to realize that my education isn‚Äôt enough. The health problems in this village are more complex than I had imagined. Every day, I face cases that require specialized treatment‚Äîtreatment I can‚Äôt provide because I haven‚Äôt had the chance to pursue higher education.</p>\n<p>I dream of becoming more than just a village doctor. With advanced training, I could diagnose and treat conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory problems‚Äîdiseases that claim lives here simply because people can‚Äôt afford to go elsewhere. But the cost of pursuing further studies is overwhelming. My earnings from this small chamber are barely enough to support my family, let alone pay for advanced education. And yet, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that my people deserve better care, that I owe it to them to learn more.</p>\n<p>Every day I sit in my chamber, watching the villagers file in, each with their own story of struggle. And every day, I hold on to the hope that one day I will find the means to continue my education, not for my own gain, but for them‚Äîfor the people who need more than I can currently give.</p>'),

To ensure the falls are permanently protected, Run Wild has reserved $50,000 from its mission funds to contribute to this important cause and has embarked upon a fundraising campaign to raise an additional $150,000. We believe that the State of New York will cover the remaining balance.</p>\n<p>New York is a conservation success story, thanks to countless campaigns like this one over many, many years.

For more information, visit us at www.runwildhv.org\n</p>\n<p>Note: 100% of your contribution will go to this campaign. We will not use any of your contribution to cover expenses. If we raise more funds than are necessary to exercise the option, or in the event that the option is not exercised for reasons outside of our control, we will retain the funds contributed for future land conservation and stewardship opportunities in the Hudson Valley.</p>');
