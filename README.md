# Web-Development-II---A3

Task 3 was used to demonstrate the complete skills of developing a dynamic website. In this task I improved the client site and developed the admin site while adding more relevant api's to meet the requirements.

Welcome to the our Crowdfunding Platform Project! This dynamic web application is designed to facilitate fundraising activities by allowing users to make donations and administrators to manage fundraisers and categories. The platform includes a client-side website built with Angular for a rich user interface and an admin-side website for backend management. The backend is developed using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL, ensuring efficient data handling and retrieval. The platform is deployed on SCU cPanel for easy accessibility over the Internet .

Features:
Client-side
· Donation Page: Users can donate to specific fundraisers.
· Fundraiser Page: Displays fundraiser details and a list of donations sorted by the latest date.
· Donation Form: Users can input their donation amount and details.
Admin-side
· Home Page: Displays a list of all fundraisers.
· Add Fundraiser: Form to add new fundraisers.
· Update Fundraiser: Form to update existing fundraisers, including a list of donations.
· Delete Fundraiser: Option to delete fundraisers that have not received any donations.
